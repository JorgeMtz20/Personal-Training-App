Senior Project Proposal - UTRGV

Student : Jorge Martinez

Advisor : Erik Enriquez

Background:
I’m a big advocate of fitness and health. I want to combine my skills as a certified personal 
trainer, certified nutrition coach, and computer science major to create a web application that 
brings those worlds together. With my knowledge of fitness, health, and computer science I will 
be creating a fitness and health app.

Problem/Opportunity Statement:
Many people struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to a lack of personalized guidance and 
accessible tools. There's a nationwide problem right now with unhealthy lifestyles. According to 
the CDC about 42% of US adults are obese. Healthy or sick this application demographic is 
everyone (everyone needs to live a healthy life). Some of the main features for this web 
application is going to offer tailored workout routines, meal planning, and sleep advisement to 
help users achieve their fitness and health goals.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution is a web application that provides personalized fitness and health 
guidance. Some features it will have:
• Customizable workout routines based on user goals, experience, and equipment available.
• Meal planning with dietary preferences and nutrition tracking.
• Sleep advisement.

Capstone Merit:
This project is innovative because it merges fitness, nutrition, and sleep habits into a single 
platform, allowing people to monitor and improve their overall health. It also demonstrates the 
application of computer science skills in a real-world context, providing me an opportunity to 
use my expertise in both fitness and computer science
